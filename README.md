# GIZ NLP Agricultural Keyword Spotter
    
## üóí<span style='color:green'> Description </span>

The objective of this challenge is to classify agricultural audio keywords in English and Lugandan from Uganda.
For more information about this challenge, have a look on [Zindi](https://zindi.africa/competitions/giz-nlp-agricultural-keyword-spotter).

##  üò∑<span style='color:green'> The solution </span> üß†

Our solution consist of a mix of Resnet34 and Resnet50. During the training, we used a single augmentation (SpecAugmentation) strategy from [torchlibrosa](https://github.com/qiuqiangkong/torchlibrosa), which randomly cutout/erase some parts of the spectogram along the frequency and time dimensions.

* Resnet34 was the best scorer with a public leaderboard of **0.84** (Logloss).
* Resnet50 followed with a public LB of **0.88**.
* A simple average of 2 Resnet34 gave us **0.8075** on the public LB.
* Our final solution was a weighted average og the Resnet50 and 2 x Resnet34, for a small boost of **-0.06**.

NB: We tried other architectures like Densenet, Efficienet, but it seemed that they were overfitting (LB of 1.+)
